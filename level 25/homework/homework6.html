    <p><b style="background-color: lime;">Fast & Furious,</b> nota anche come Fast and Furious, è una serie cinematografica statunitense di film d'azione basata principalmente sulle corse d'auto clandestine. A partire dal quarto film la serie muta in parte i suoi connotati caratteristici, aggiungendo elementi che l'avvicinano sempre più al filone dei film di spionaggio e degli heist movie.

        La serie verte sulle vicende di due personaggi, Dominic Toretto e Brian O'Conner, interpretati rispettivamente da Vin Diesel e Paul Walker; tuttavia, a seguito della prematura scomparsa di Walker, il personaggio di O'Conner è stato fatto uscire di scena a partire dall'ottavo film. Negli anni la serie si è trasformata sempre più in un ensemble cast e ha visto aggiungersi, fra gli altri, icone del cinema d'azione come Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Gal Gadot, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, John Cena e Jason Momoa.[1]
        
        Il franchise comprende anche uno spin-off, due cortometraggi e una serie animata.</p>

            The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. It is a standalone sequel to The Fast and the Furious (2001) and 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), and the third installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. It stars Lucas Black and Bow Wow. In the film, car enthusiast Sean Boswell (Black) is sent to live in Tokyo with his estranged father and finds solace exploring the city's drifting community.
            
            A third Fast & Furious film was confirmed in June 2005, when Lin was selected as director. Morgan was hired after an open call soon after, thus marking the first film in the franchise's longtime association with Lin, Morgan, actor Sung Kang, and composer Brian Tyler.[6][7] Principal photography began in August 2005 and lasted until that November, with filming locations including Los Angeles and Tokyo, making Tokyo Drift the first film in the franchise to feature an international filming location.</p>
